# Experiment Execution

Bridge from a stable experiment plan to running experiments and initial results.

## Detect environment

Detect environment from project's CLAUDE.md: local / remote SSH / Vast.ai / Modal. Modal handles its own code sync + GPU allocation — delegate.

## Pre-flight

Before deploying anything:

- Verify GPU availability (free GPU = `memory.used < 500 MiB`).
- Check SSH connection works (remote).
- Check conda env / cwd exist on remote.
- Check all preconditions (checkpoints, input files).
- Check enough free GPUs for the parallel target.

If any precondition fails, show which jobs are blocked and why.

## Code sync (remote)

- rsync only necessary files (python / yaml / json / sh), exclude data / checkpoints / large files.
- If `code_sync: git`, use git push + remote pull instead (version-tracked, multi-server sync with one push).
- For Vast.ai, always rsync to `/workspace/project/`.

## W&B integration (when configured)

Ensure scripts have `wandb.init` + `wandb.log` for training loss, lr, eval metrics, GPU memory, throughput. Verify wandb login on target.

## Implement experiment code

- Check existing code first; reuse as much as possible.
- Implement missing pieces: training script with argparse (all hyperparameters configurable), eval scripts, data loading, baseline impls, fixed seeds for reproducibility, JSON / CSV result format, proper logging.
- Follow plan's run order: sanity → baseline → main → ablation → polish.
- Self-review before deploy: hyperparameters reflected in argparse? Seed fixed and controllable? Results in parseable format? Code matches STATE.md run specification?

## Cross-model code review (before deploy)

Send experiment code to a different-model reviewer with these checks:

1. Does the code correctly implement the method described in STATE.md A1/A2/A3?
2. Are all hyperparameters reflected in the code?
3. Are there logic bugs (wrong loss function, incorrect data split, missing eval)?
4. Is the evaluation metric computed correctly?
5. **CRITICAL: Does evaluation use the dataset's actual ground truth labels — NOT another model's output as ground truth?**
6. Any potential issues (OOM risk, numerical instability, missing seeds)?

For each issue: classify CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR + exact fix.

On results: no CRITICAL → proceed; CRITICAL → fix + re-submit (max 2 rounds); reviewer unavailable → skip silently (graceful degradation).

## Sanity first

Before deploying the full suite, run the sanity-stage experiment. Verify training loop runs without errors, metrics computed and saved correctly, GPU memory within bounds, output format matches expectations.

Never deploy a full suite without verifying sanity passes.

## Auto-debug failed sanity (max 3 attempts)

Never give up on the first failure. Most crashes are fixable without human intervention.

1. **Read the error**: traceback, stderr, log files.
2. **Diagnose**:
   - OOM → reduce batch size or enable gradient checkpointing
   - ImportError → install package
   - FileNotFoundError → fix path or download data
   - CUDA error → check GPU / reduce model size
   - NaN / divergence → reduce lr / check preprocessing
3. **Fix and re-run**.
4. **Attempt 2+ still failing** → cross-model rescue: an independent model often catches issues the first missed (wrong tensor shapes, subtle import shadowing, config mismatches).
5. **Still failing after 3 attempts** → stop. Report failure with all attempted fixes + error logs. Do not proceed with broken code.

## Route deployment by job count

- **Small batch** (≤5 jobs per milestone) → single-shot launcher. Each experiment gets its own screen session + GPU binding (remote) or background process (local). Use `tee` for logs.
- **Large batch** (≥10 jobs, multi-seed sweeps, or phase dependencies) → queue-based orchestration with OOM-aware retry, stale-screen cleanup, wave-transition race prevention, phase dependency enforcement, crash-safe state persistence.

Auto-routing: a milestone with ≥10 jobs (seeds × configs) or teacher → student phase dependencies → queue; otherwise single-shot.

## Queue orchestration (high level)

When using queue, scheduler responsibilities:

- For each pending job, assign to free GPU, launch via screen.
- Poll job status (every 60s).
- Detect stale screens (python exited but screen detached → kill).
- Detect OOM (CUDA OOM in log → mark `failed_oom` → retry after delay).
- Detect completion (expected output file exists → mark `completed`).
- Launch next wave only when current wave settles (all python exited, no stale screens, GPU memory dropped below threshold, preconditions for next wave met).
- Write state to JSON continuously; idempotent on restart.

Job state machine: `pending → running → completed`. Side branches: `failed_oom → pending` (after delay, retry up to N); `failed_other → stuck` (manual inspection); `stale_screen_detected → cleaned → pending`.

OOM handling: mark `failed_oom`, kill screen, wait delay, try another free GPU (or same when free), requeue as `pending`. Max N retries before `stuck`.

## After main experiments

If main results are positive → route into ablation planning (see ablation section in experiment-planning). If negative or inconclusive, skip ablation and note in summary.

## Auto-destroy cloud instances

When using vast.ai with `auto_destroy: true`: after experiment completes, download results + logs, destroy instance, report cost. Users never billed for idle instances.

## Always

- ALWAYS check GPU availability first — never blindly assign GPUs (Modal manages automatically).
- Each experiment its own screen session + GPU (remote) or background process (local).
- Use `tee` to save logs.
- Run deployment commands with `run_in_background: true` to keep conversation responsive.
- Multiple experiments → launch in parallel on different GPUs.
- **CRITICAL — Evaluation must use dataset ground truth.** ALWAYS compare model predictions against the dataset's actual ground truth labels / targets — NEVER another model's output. Double-check: (1) ground truth comes from the dataset split (not from a baseline / backbone), (2) metrics computed against the same ground truth for all methods, (3) use official eval scripts when available.
- **Follow the plan.** Do not invent experiments not in the plan. If something is missing, note but don't add.
- **Sanity first.** Never deploy a full suite without sanity passing.
- **Reuse existing code.** Scan project before writing new scripts. Extend, don't duplicate.
- **Save everything as JSON / CSV.** Downstream review needs parseable results.
- **Update the tracker** after each run completes.
- **Don't wait forever.** If an experiment exceeds 2× its estimated time, flag and move on.
- **Budget awareness.** Track GPU-hours against the plan's budget. Warn approaching limit.
- **Vast.ai cost awareness**: report running cost; if `auto_destroy: true`, destroy as soon as all experiments on it complete.
- **Modal cost awareness**: estimate and display cost before running. Auto-scales to zero — no idle billing.
- **Never overlap screens on same GPU** — always wait for `memory.used < 500 MiB`.
- **State to disk** — every state change flushed to state JSON (for queue orchestration).
- **Idempotent scheduler** — safe to restart; picks up from state file.
- **Expected-output-based completion** — verify output file exists; don't trust screen state alone.
- **Bounded retry** — max N OOM retries, then `stuck` and alert.
- **Dependencies enforced at launch** — never launch student before teacher checkpoint exists.
